    <p>
      You have been invited to take part in a research study named ARC (Abstract Reasoning Corpus). The
      purpose of this study is to investigate how people learn in dynamic tasks. If you agree to be in this
      study, you will be asked to look at pictures of objects or pictures presented on a computer display,
      watch videos, listen to sounds, or observe lights controlled by the computer and to make judgments about
      them using a keyboard, mouse, or other input device attached to a computer.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Participation in this study will take about 30 minutes to complete, and you will receive $10.00 for
        your participation. As an additional incentive to try your best at the task, you may earn a cash
        bonus of up to $1.00 based on your performance. Participation in the study is voluntary and you may
        withdraw at any time. If you withdraw, you will be paid a portion of the full compensation based on
        the percentage of the study completed.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you complete the study, a thorough verbal and written explanation of it will be provided.
      </li>
      <li>
        In addition, by agreeing to participate, you understand you must be 18 years or older to
        participate.
      </li>
      <li>
        You will receive no direct benefits from participating in this study. However, it may make you more
        aware of how knowledge is discovered in psychology. It may also help researchers better understand
        how people solve insight problems.
      </li>
      <li>
        Confidentiality of your research records will be strictly maintained. We assign code numbers to each
        participant so that data is never directly linked to individual identity, and we are interested in
        group results rather than the responses of particular individuals. Any emails will never be shared
        with anyone nor linked to your data. Data are kept in our laboratory and are only viewed by the
        investigators. These data files are kept on our computer indefinitely.
      </li>
      <li>
        Taking part in this study is voluntary. Not taking part or withdrawing after the study has begun
        will result in no loss of services from NYU to which you are otherwise entitled. You have the right
        to skip or not answer any questions you prefer not to answer.
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is anything about the study or your participation that is unclear or that you do not
      understand, if you have questions or wish to report a research-related problem, you may contact the
      principal investigator, <a href="http://todd.gureckislab.org">Todd M. Gureckis</a> at 6 Washington Place

      questions about your rights as a
      research participant, you may contact the University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects,
      New York University, 665 Broadway, Suite 804, New York, NY 10012, at ask.humansubjects@nyu.edu or (212)
